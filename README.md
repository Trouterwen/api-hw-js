## Note
Apologies in advance for the late assignment. Working on our graded group project made me completely forget about the assignment. That being said i have it all right here for you now.
I appreciate your time. 

## functionality
in this assignment i used the weather api attached to the course readme and pulled its data into this webpage using a fetch call and javascript for loops.

on the page when a city is typed in you are given a weather card giving the weather data for that city at the current moment as well as 5 more cards displaying the weather forecast for the next 5 days as well.
